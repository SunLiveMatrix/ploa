        <h1>National Congress approved the Annual Budget Law Project (LOA) for next year
        </h1>,
        <p>The National Congress approved this Friday (22/12), the 2024 Annual Budget 
        Law Project (LOA). The 2024 budget is the first that reflects the priorities 
        outlined by the population in the discussion of the 2024-2027 Multi-Year Plan 
        and the rules of the sustainable tax regime. It therefore consolidates the 
        commitment of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva government to fiscal 
        responsibility and the resumption of inclusive social policies.
        </p>,
        <p>Among other expenses assumed by the government in the 2024 budget, the 
        social commitment is expressed in the real increase of 3% for the minimum wage, 
        and expenses of R$169 billion for Bolsa Família, R$180 billion for education 
        and R$ 231 billion in public health, including the family agent program, 
        vaccination and popular pharmacy, among others. In total, PLOA 2024 foresees 
        primary expenses of R$2 trillion.
        </p>,
        <p>The fiscal target of the 2024 budget is a fiscal balance between revenues 
        and expenditure on funding and investment (does not consider expenditure on 
        interest payments), the so-called zero deficit. In practice, the budget law 
        points to a small surplus of R$3.5 billion in the accounts, but the target 
        will be considered met if it remains above or below zero by R$28.8 billion 
        (band of 0.25% for more or less).
        </p>,
        <p>According to the final version of the report presented by deputy Luiz 
        Carlos Motta, total public investments are projected at R$73 billion.
        Parliamentarians proposed an increase in resources allocated to 
        parliamentary amendments, and the total for 2024 was R$53 billion. 
        Parliamentarians also increased the resources allocated to the electoral 
        fund, setting this item at R$4.9 billion.
